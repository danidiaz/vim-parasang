# stuff I found useful while writing this plugin

- `:h search()` 
- `:h searchpos()` Example `:echo searchpos("\\%#fooo","ceW")`
- [How can I get a token from a search in a whole file in vimscript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1228100/substituting-zero-width-match-in-vim-script) Strange that there isn't a more direct way.
- `:h \%#` Matches current cursor position.
- [Functional Parsing - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDtZLm7HIJs)
- [Vimscript functions must start with a capital letter if they are unscoped!](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/23.html)

> Even if you do add a scope to a function (we'll talk about that later) you may as well capitalize the first letter of function names anyway. Most Vimscript coders seem to do it, so don't break the convention.
