# stuff I found useful while writing this plugin

- `:h search()` 
- `:h searchpos()` Example `:echo searchpos("\\%#fooo","ceW")`
- [How can I get a token from a search in a whole file in vimscript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1228100/substituting-zero-width-match-in-vim-script) Strange that there isn't a more direct way.
- `:h \%#` Matches current cursor position.
